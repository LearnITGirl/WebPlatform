However, we are sad to say after evaluating your final self­-evaluation form, we cannot award you a diploma.\r\n\r\nIf you think there has been an error in the result, please contact us by replying to this email. Make sure you  filled in the final self­-evaluation survey.\r\n\r\nWe hope you had a good experience with “Learn IT, Girl” and hope you continue to help women learn how to code in the future.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n<i>The \"Learn IT, Girl!\" team</i>"
